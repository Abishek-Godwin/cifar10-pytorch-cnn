# CIFAR-10 CNN Classifier (PyTorch, CPU-only, <2hr Training)

This repository contains my submission for the University of York’s IMLO coursework project. It features a deep convolutional neural network trained from scratch in PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- ✅ 84% test accuracy on CIFAR-10
- ⚙️ Fully custom PyTorch CNN architecture (no pretrained weights)
- 🕒 Trains in under **2 hours** on CPU-only
- 🧪 Reproducible results using Conda environment setup
- 🔧 Includes all code, configuration files, and trained model

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch ≥ 2.6.0
- torchvision
- numpy, matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Set up environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
